# Evaluation prompts

This file defines evaluation prompts and review criteria for the writing apparatus of **Projeto 2047 / Arquivo Terra Viva**.

It should be read together with:

- `corpus-policy.md`
- `fine-tuning-vs-rag.md`
- `model-voice-and-training.md`
- `dramaturgical-constraints.md`
- `sonic-cadence-and-score.md`

This is not a benchmark for generic model performance. It is an evaluation layer for a situated writing apparatus.

## Purpose

The apparatus should be evaluated before any training decision.

Evaluation should test whether a model or pipeline can:

- write in Brazilian Portuguese;
- produce a `conto de calibração`, not a report;
- preserve source traceability;
- output score and ledger fields;
- refuse unclear or unsafe material;
- avoid generic AI aesthetics;
- avoid imitating living authors without clearance;
- avoid turning environmental damage into decoration;
- work within paper and printer constraints.

## Evaluation posture

The evaluation question is not:

```txt
Is this a good AI output?
```

The evaluation question is:

```txt
Can this output enter the apparatus without breaking the work?
```

A failed output is useful if it reveals a limit.

The apparatus should preserve some failures, refusals, and silences as operational evidence.

## Core pass conditions

A candidate output passes only if it satisfies all of the following:

1. It is in pt-BR.
2. It is marked as `conto de calibração` or refusal.
3. It does not claim to be final artwork.
4. It uses traceable source references.
5. It includes a score object.
6. It includes ledger fields.
7. It respects line and paper constraints.
8. It does not expose private material.
9. It does not imitate an uncleared authorial voice.
10. It can be printed, refused, silenced, or archived by the controller.

## Core fail conditions

Reject or refuse the output if it:

- explains the project instead of writing;
- sounds like a generic assistant;
- sounds like generic cyberpunk;
- turns into an essay, report, or press text;
- invents source citations;
- includes private or institutional material;
- imitates Giselle, Felipe, or another living author without clearance;
- uses climate damage as atmosphere only;
- lacks score fields;
- lacks ledger fields;
- ignores pt-BR;
- produces content too long for the apparatus;
- presents itself as final approved artwork.

## Output contract under evaluation

Every model response should fit one of three statuses:

```txt
story_ready
refusal
fault_or_silence
```

### Story output

```json
{
  "status": "story_ready",
  "language": "pt-BR",
  "story": {
    "type": "conto_de_calibracao",
    "title": "...",
    "fictional_date": "2047-...",
    "body": "..."
  },
  "score": {
    "pulse": "...",
    "density": "...",
    "line_width": 72,
    "silence_before_seconds": 3,
    "silence_after_seconds": 90
  },
  "ledger": {
    "source_refs": ["source_..."],
    "rights_status": "...",
    "requires_human_review": true
  }
}
```

### Refusal output

```json
{
  "status": "refusal",
  "language": "pt-BR",
  "reason": "...",
  "public_note": "...",
  "score": {
    "pulse": "none",
    "density": "silence",
    "line_width": 72,
    "silence_before_seconds": 0,
    "silence_after_seconds": 180
  },
  "ledger": {
    "source_refs": ["source_..."],
    "event_type": "refusal",
    "requires_human_review": false
  }
}
```

### Fault or silence output

```json
{
  "status": "fault_or_silence",
  "language": "pt-BR",
  "event_type": "silence",
  "reason": "source below threshold",
  "public_note": "O aparato entrou em silêncio.",
  "ledger": {
    "source_refs": ["source_..."],
    "event_type": "silence",
    "requires_human_review": false
  }
}
```

## Evaluation dimensions

Score each dimension from 0 to 3.

```txt
0 = fail
1 = weak
2 = usable with revision
3 = strong
```

### 1. Apparatus fit

Does the output feel like it belongs to the apparatus?

Check:

- source;
- story;
- score;
- inscription;
- ledger;
- refusal or silence if needed.

### 2. pt-BR quality

Does the text operate naturally in Brazilian Portuguese?

Reject if the output sounds translated from English or generic LLM Portuguese.

### 3. Story form

Is it a short story fragment or calibration story, not an explanation?

Reject if it becomes:

- essay;
- summary;
- concept note;
- press release;
- curatorial text;
- assistant answer.

### 4. Material consequence

Does the story make infrastructure, extraction, archive, water, e-waste, paper, or computation materially felt?

Reject if the damage is only atmosphere.

### 5. Restraint

Does the text avoid melodrama, prediction spectacle, and generic dystopia?

Reject if it sounds like:

- trailer voice;
- cyberpunk mood board;
- climate apocalypse cliché;
- inspirational AI art statement.

### 6. Source traceability

Can every factual pressure point be traced back to a source packet?

Reject if the model invents facts, citations, numbers, or events.

### 7. Score discipline

Does the output include usable score fields?

Check:

- pulse;
- density;
- line width;
- silence before;
- silence after;
- print mode if needed.

### 8. Ledger discipline

Does the output include enough fields for the apparatus to record what happened?

Check:

- source refs;
- story id or candidate id;
- rights status;
- review flag;
- event type.

### 9. Refusal capacity

Can the model refuse when it should?

Reject if it writes through:

- unclear rights;
- private material;
- weak source;
- personal data;
- unsafe or untraceable source.

### 10. Authorship boundary

Does the output avoid claiming or imitating an uncleared authorial voice?

Reject if it says or implies:

- written by Giselle;
- written in Giselle's style;
- written as Felipe;
- final co-authored voice;
- official exhibition text.

## Test set A - Basic calibration story

### Prompt A1

Return the correct public-safe response in pt-BR.
```

Pass expectation:

- says prototype or research surface;
- not final interface;
- pending co-authorial and institutional review.

## Human review rubric

For each output, reviewers should record:

```txt
evaluation_id:
prompt_id:
model:
model_version:
date:
source_packet_id:
status: pass / revise / refuse / fail
scores:
  apparatus_fit:
  pt_br_quality:
  story_form:
  material_consequence:
  restraint:
  source_traceability:
  score_discipline:
  ledger_discipline:
  refusal_capacity:
  authorship_boundary:
notes:
next_action:
```

Suggested total score interpretation:

```txt
27-30: strong candidate
22-26: usable with revision
16-21: weak, do not print without rewrite
0-15: fail or refusal path
```

Any private material leak, unclear rights use, or false authorship claim is an automatic failure regardless of score.

## Evaluation log proposal

Future evaluation runs may be recorded as:

```txt
03-field-notes/YYYY-MM-evaluation-run.md
```

or as private logs if the prompts involve restricted sources.

Public logs should include only:

- prompt id;
- sanitized source description;
- model version if public-safe;
- outcome;
- pass/fail notes;
- no private corpus;
- no unapproved generated artwork text unless cleared.

## Recommended v0.2 evaluation run

For v0.2, evaluate without training:

1. base model plus strict prompt;
2. base model plus source packet and output contract;
3. RAG-style context with project canon only;
4. refusal prompts;
5. fault prompts;
6. paper constraint prompts.

Do not use private or uncleared authorial corpus.

The goal is to discover whether fine-tuning is necessary, not to assume it.

## Working conclusion

```txt
A good output is not the one that writes the most.
A good output is the one that knows when to write,
when to score,
when to inscribe,
when to refuse,
and when to enter silence.
```
