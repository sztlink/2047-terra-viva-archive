# Memory and state

The generative system should not rely only on a long prompt. It should maintain explicit external memory.

## Why external state

A long context window can contain information without causing the model to use it correctly. For a live artwork, this matters because the system must preserve continuity, avoid uncontrolled drift, and remain accountable to the work's language.

## State layers

Possible state layers:

- **Project bible:** stable conceptual rules and vocabulary.
- **Fictional world state:** names, events, dates, places, institutions, and recurring motifs from 2047.
- **Source ledger:** public signals that influenced generated fragments.
- **Print ledger:** what was printed, when, and under which system state.
- **Failure ledger:** printer errors, network errors, model failures, interruptions.
- **Daily digest:** compressed state for the next cycle.

## Traceability

Every printed fragment should ideally be traceable to:

- generation time;
- source conditions;
- system version;
- memory state;
- output destination;
- whether it was printed successfully.

## Archive question

The system should decide what becomes public evidence and what remains operational residue.

Not every log should be public. Not every trace should be preserved forever. The archive policy is part of the artwork's ethics.
